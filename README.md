## Welcome to the azure python notebooks 
I found these notebooks that I used in the past when I took my python class.
I hope thses notes can be helpful

## How to run these notebooks
To run these notebooks you will need to make an account on the [Microsoft Azure Notebooks website](https://notebooks.azure.com/). Once you have created your account, you can then up the folders I have listed in this repo and then click on the .pynb file and it should run.


## Extra info
I do not believe you need the HTML files to run the notebooks, I don't know why we had them but I just included them just incase.
The section 5 has files that say section 4 but they are section 5 if I have not chnaged them by this time.
